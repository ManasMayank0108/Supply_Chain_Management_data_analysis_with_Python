# Restaurant_data_analysis_with_Python

Overview:-
Supply chain logistics play a crucial role in ensuring efficient transportation, warehousing, and inventory management. This project focuses on analyzing a real-world dataset to uncover inefficiencies, optimize operations, and enhance decision-making. The insights gained from this analysis can help organizations streamline their supply chain processes, reduce costs, and improve service delivery.

The analysis will address key challenges such as delayed shipments, excessive transportation costs, inefficient warehousing practices, and suboptimal supplier performance. By leveraging data-driven insights, businesses can enhance their supply chain strategy and improve overall operational efficiency.

Dataset
File Name: Supply chain logistics problem (original).xlsx

Contents:
Shipment details: Includes information on shipment IDs, departure and arrival locations, and transit times.
Delivery timelines: Contains expected vs. actual delivery times to assess efficiency.
